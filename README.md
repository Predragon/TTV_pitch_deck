Slide 2: Mission & Origin Story

Mission: Prevent relationship breakdown through better communication — one message at a time.

Founder’s Story: In 2024, while detained and isolated from family, I realized text messages were making things worse. Miscommunication—not lack of love—was killing connection. That moment seeded The Third Voice: a digital mediator to translate emotion and intent.

Slide 3: The Problem

Digital messages misfire—causing conflict, legal costs, and emotional toll:

54M divorced or separated adults in the U.S.

15M co-parents: avg. $8,400/year in conflict costs

2.3M monthly searches: "communicate better with my ex"

73% experience monthly escalation from texting

Slide 4: The Solution

The Third Voice rewrites emotionally charged messages to prevent fights:

Real-time rewrite suggestions

Tone classification (happy/neutral/aggressive/passive-aggressive)

Sentiment tracking, shared memory

Court-ready documentation for co-parents

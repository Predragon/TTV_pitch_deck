## Slide 2: Mission & Origin Story

### Mission
Prevent relationship breakdown through better communication — one message at a time.

### Founder's Story
In 2024, while detained and isolated from family, I realized text messages were making things worse. Miscommunication—not lack of love—was killing connection. That moment seeded The Third Voice: a digital mediator to translate emotion and intent.

---

## Slide 3: The Problem

### Digital messages misfire—causing conflict, legal costs, and emotional toll:

- **54M** divorced or separated adults in the U.S.
- **15M** co-parents: avg. **$8,400/year** in conflict costs
- **2.3M** monthly searches: "communicate better with my ex"
- **73%** experience monthly escalation from texting

---

## Slide 4: The Solution

### The Third Voice rewrites emotionally charged messages to prevent fights:

- Real-time rewrite suggestions
- Tone classification (happy/neutral/aggressive/passive-aggressive)
- Sentiment tracking, shared memory
- Court-ready documentation for co-parents
